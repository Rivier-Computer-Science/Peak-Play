                - **Warm-Up & Mobility**: Dynamic stretching, activation drills, and movement prep for sport-specific readiness.  
                - **Strength & Power Development**: Sport-relevant resistance training, plyometrics, and core stabilization exercises.  
                - **Speed, Agility & Endurance**: Acceleration drills, agility ladders, lateral quickness training, and HIIT conditioning.  
                - **Sport-Specific Skill Work**: Movement patterns directly related to the athlete’s sport (e.g., cutting drills for soccer, jump mechanics for basketball).  
                - **Recovery & Injury Prevention**: Flexibility routines, mobility work, prehab exercises, and proper cooldown strategies.  

                Ensure exercises are **personalized based on the athlete’s sport, skill level, and training goals**,
